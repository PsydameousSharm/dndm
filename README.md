This is a very early release of list of dnd tools.
These are the following commands:

Roll a dice: roll <dice_number> [repeat]

Change the save path: svc <path>

Create a character: chr

Please note that the chr command will walk you through the character setup. To avoid errors, please try to not use spaces when entering information(asides from the character name).

##INSTALL##
